Grind the Idli rice and the Ural Dal along with the fenugreek seeds to a coarse batter.
Keep the batter aside overnight for the process of fermentation.
After the batter rises, it is ready to be used.
Now heat a pan on the stove.
After the pan is heated pour a big spoon of the batter and spread it around the pan in a circular shape.
Now pour a small spoon of cooking oil around.
Turn the dosa around after it is slightly golden brown in colour.
After it is slightly roasted on the other side also turn it, now it is ready!
